## 1) AWS Security Groups.

      AWS security groups act like firewall to your EC-2 instance, which controls inbound and outbound traffic.
      When you launch an instance on AWS you need to assign it to a particular security group.
      
  ### 1) **Inbound Rules:**
         
         Inbound rules controls the incoming traffic that is allowed to reach your EC-2 instance.The traffic can come from anywhere 
         or from your's machine IP as per your inbound rules.
  
  ### 2) **Outbound Rules:**
  
         Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic that is allowed to leave from your's EC-2 instance.To connect to internet or 
         any browser you have to add outbound rules.
